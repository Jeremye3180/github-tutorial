## Git vs. GitHub

Git and Github are very similar to eachother, but they are two completely different tools.
here is the rundown:

###Git 

* is essentially a snapshot of your code,  

  * is known as version control.




 
###Github

* is an area that stores code online   
or what is known as a cloud 
* It is also used to work on diffent parts of code  with other people.
  
 * The cool part is that you don't have to be on the same computer together  since you can exchange parts of code via internet to partners who can edit, fix, change, or work with the code to make it work
